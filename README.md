# ImageClassification

## Install & Run

1. Python 3.
2. NVIDIA cuDNN (Optional).
3. `pip install -r requirements`.
4. Run `classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any IDE with its extension.

## TODO

Improve `classifier.ipynb` according to `classifier*.py`. Currently, `classifier*.py`s cannot work, but the networks they used are supposed to be better than that in `classifier.ipynb`.
